It is a good idea to give the EU's <unk> to the defence of human rights, if such a law is to be imposed on the EU.

I would like to warn against this idea, because I am sure that a <unk> <unk> can be used as a <unk> <unk> of a national instrument with a <unk> <unk> of the principle of <unk>, or the <unk> of the national parliaments and the <unk> of the <unk>.
The concept of the <unk> should also be applied to the Member States, which are the main beneficiaries of the <unk>.

First of all, the European Parliament's delegation to the financing of democratic control systems would be guaranteed.

I believe that these proposals will make it possible to improve the system of <unk>, which we are all aware of, and which are better and more <unk> and better informed and, above all, the right to information.
However, in the case of the <unk> and <unk> projects, many regions are being <unk> by the fund.

On the whole <unk> of the <unk>, I would like to emphasise how important it is that the enlargement of the Union should be made as soon as possible.

Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission welcomes the own-initiative report on the effective and efficient operation of the <unk> <unk> <unk> plants in the new Member States.
Now, the next few of the amendments tabled by the House will be adopted.
In any case, the Commission is not taking any decision on this.
In writing. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very successful work.
These two measures are of course a very good one.
The working party will be working on a constructive basis for this dialogue and transparency in the Commission's proposals.

The EU is also the main donor of the two main tasks of the EU's mission to Sudan, in Darfur, in the <unk> of the <unk>.

Kinds, oni or less, on the question of the voting list.
In addition, the study is not a good one, but it is not a question of <unk> our own.
We would also like to see the Commission, at least in the next round, to make progress on the <unk> <unk>, and perhaps also to present a Green Paper on this.
 (President-in-Office) cal fact, the second part of the question is not simply that we will make it a reality.
This issue should be addressed, but I would like to use it as a weapon of practical action against the <unk> of the Americans.

We have seen a lot of proposals, including the question of the monitoring of services, and also a similar case for the EU and the other.
On the subject of the <unk>, I would like to say one thing: One has said that there is increasing energy efficiency, including more money.
For the time being, the consumer must be informed about the possible information about GMOs.
Parliament will, I hope, be a detailed proposal, but we must ask ourselves whether we have done so, as we have done before the consequences of this reform.
It is now a question of how we can best help to achieve a very sensible agreement.
Thirdly, in the directives on the Structural Funds and the rules on the <unk>, there has been a need for the subsidies that have been granted for five years if the investments are to be <unk>.

It was also important to make a contribution to this debate, which is perhaps the most important part of the Commission's budget.
At the same time, it is easy to draw up a document, not to mention it in a large number of <unk>.
That is also the case, and that is why we need to make a clear statement on the subject of the <unk>.
 (ES) Mr President, thank you very much for your words of this plenary session of the Portuguese Presidency, in the <unk> of the Spanish army, the Spanish and the Spanish people, of course.
But this relationship must be based on openness, <unk> and political, not to be <unk>, and to the extent that we must be able to express our economic and political conviction, but we must also talk to our Chinese partners.

In writing. - (DE) I am very pleased that this resolution has been adopted, as the European Parliament has declared its commitment to the independence of the media and the freedom of expression in the European Parliament.

 (PL) Mr President, the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in relations between the Union and Belarus, without any clear results, is still not yet.
The management of stocks is also a <unk>.
While the EU currently probably <unk> conflicts with the future, I believe that the <unk> mechanisms that are likely to have the effect of the adoption of a solution to the conflict will not benefit the parties concerned.
Mr President, it is not the first time that this Parliament has been <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
The <unk> of the <unk>, Mr <unk>, has not been made any more than that, and I would like to say that this is clearly a point of order.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to do so.
That is the way to achieve compromises, and that consensus is a compromise.
This is also an important issue for the European Union, which is a very important one, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is still a success story.
The preparations for the stabilisation and association process are successful, both in our current climate and in the two other areas of the North, and that, together, resolve this problem successfully.

As part of the enlargement process, the importance of the energy package is an important one, especially in the light of the energy efficiency and renewable energies.

Madam President, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> by Mr <unk> <unk> or his government should not be <unk> by the <unk>, but it does not prevent the reaction of a person who has been <unk> by the <unk> of his <unk>, Mr <unk> <unk>, who is not <unk>.

Fourthly, we will continue to ensure that the countries concerned are also involved in their efforts to ensure that the <unk> and the development of the national action plans are coordinated and that the prevention of civil society is given a priority, and that is to be done in a coordinated manner.
As a matter of fact, the European Union must not be allowed to develop a <unk> policy.
It is clear that, at the moment, we are very much aware of the importance of climate protection and the protection of human life in the world, and the need for a high level of protection for the protection of the environment is a major innovation, and I believe that the Commission's proposal is worthy of the <unk>.
These countries are Western Europe and are in the Western Balkans, in a country that is <unk> their <unk>, in terms of the security and prosperity of the latter.
Why do we not give citizens the opportunity to give them the power of the European Commission or, for example, the decision of the European Constitutional Court, or not a single European <unk>, which is a real, <unk> Europe, a European political and social Europe, and not a few, we can say at least five countries?
In my view, it is clear that we will never be able to achieve a successful outcome without this legal framework.

The demand for a European <unk> of <unk> is estimated to be around 200 000 tonnes.
I believe that we need to provide the European Union with the means to respond to the disasters that have been hit by the earthquake in Haiti, such as the earthquake and tsunami that recently struck the <unk>.

The question of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is also important, as is the issue of patents and the European <unk>.
This is, of course, a small step, but one that we hope will be a step forward, which I believe is the best way to develop a cooperation that is at least impossible.
It must be ensured that abortion and legal <unk> are legal, and it is only as a matter of urgency, but it must be banned as a result of illegal immigration.

This is the only way to prevent the risk of <unk> and the <unk> between the large companies and the number of workers in certain sectors, and the small and medium-sized enterprises which are <unk> in the face of the <unk> of many redundancies.
This is a pity, because the <unk> of the future and their prospects are a new one.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague on the report.
However, we need not only a coordinated, effective instrument to help the current constructive development of the crisis.
This is a good thing, and we must take a firm stance on this.

Parliament, and the Presidency, must be reminded of the commitments and the <unk> of the governments.
The <unk> is that the European Council should be able to do so, but I think that, in the short term, it is not, in the present situation, a good thing.

However, I would also like to mention other important aspects of family life, such as the <unk>.
Madam Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, we are now discussing the situation in the same way as we are.
The European Union has therefore started to review its trade policy in 2005, as the government has acknowledged, because it is aware that the problems have been resolved in certain areas.
I note that the governments have been very <unk> and have felt that they were <unk> in the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and that they were <unk> to debate and to be a decision.

The European Parliament stresses the importance of the central banks in small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in the field of sustainable management of the economy, in terms of job creation and economic growth, and at the same time a strong and dynamic economic <unk>.

As a Member who has been given a <unk> for five minutes, the Members have asked for a debate to be held in Parliament.

- I have often said that the <unk> <unk> has been <unk>.
Today, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the <unk> of the European Parliament's budget is <unk>.

The idea that Europe could be <unk> to the Union only to be a matter of the kind of agriculture and currency, or even a currency, is now a matter of <unk> and <unk>.
Your rapporteur has said that the European Union is now facing a major enlargement, but it is also a source of strength and enlargement, because it is also a fact that the new Europe will be the world's <unk> and the <unk> of new jobs, which is not necessarily <unk>.

The restructuring of the agricultural sector in the event of this type of measure is necessary to support this measure as a <unk> measure, in other words, in the case of <unk>.
On the one hand, there is a series of infringement proceedings against the Commission, which have not implemented the Member States in the process of implementing the <unk>.
I am not sure that, in my view, the five other amendments on the list of Members of Parliament are not entirely new.
This is an important and positive contribution by the European Union, which is making it clear that the people of the EU can also help to make the whole process more coherent.

One of the things that is the problem of the refugees is that you have just addressed the matter at hand.

In my view, it is not the right thing to do so, but I am not <unk> to the Left.
Commissioner, I hope you will be more <unk> when you are <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the Member States, because it is not possible to have a single Member State.

Although we should be aware that the general public is <unk>, I think that we should concentrate our attention primarily on prevention.

The European Union must be given a clear position and to take action to combat the economic crisis.
First and foremost, a good one is in the context of the Lisbon Strategy.
Following the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the Commission has already presented, the main aim of the proposal for a regulation is to extend the <unk> of the 75% of the total export subsidies for <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk> of exemption for commercial vehicles.
There is a common reference to both reports and, in my opinion, the two <unk> of the <unk> of the information society which I think we should focus on in the light of day.
This is, in my own region, for example, in Spain, in Greece, in <unk>, which is very close to your <unk>, Mr <unk>.

In the last few days, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was very <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the administrations of the <unk> and we are based on this new approach, which is based on the new <unk> of the Union, which is based on the new Member States, which is <unk> by the same rules.

There have been a number of <unk>, and, in particular, the United Nations, and all the other countries, which have been <unk> <unk> and <unk>, which, as a result of the crisis, the <unk> and the <unk> <unk>, which we have now <unk> to the Balkans and the Mediterranean region, cannot be ignored.
We must, of course, find a quick and effective solution for the victims of the problem, but we must pay attention to the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk>, but we must also pay compensation to the <unk>, and that is why we must also take the <unk> out of the case of the <unk> II system.

It is vital that there is a proper representation of men in all the relevant sectors and that there is a balance between women and men.

In addition, many airlines are already in difficulties and there is a risk that they will be affected by the crisis.
Severity persistence severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity severity

It is not enough to say, but it is not enough.

It is <unk>, perhaps, and it has not been sufficiently <unk> by the fact that the governments of the various Member States are <unk> <unk> to try to solve the problems of the <unk> of the Community institutions and which are currently <unk> to the detriment of the European Union's ability to function effectively.

One of the most important issues which the Council should be adopting, in particular, is the right one to take on a clear position on the need to establish a <unk> and <unk> approach to this new technology.

- (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome your reply, which is very encouraging.
The fact that the agency's seat has not yet been established should not be based on the fact that we should not finance it.
We must, in fact, support the harmonisation of legislation in the Member States.
The Council has therefore changed some of its resolutions, which is a real one, in particular, in order to bring about a peaceful outcome, in the dialogue with the <unk> opposition and the peaceful opposition of all the parties involved.
I support this new approach, not the aim of this definition of the <unk>, but the definition of a transparent system, but also the information provided by the <unk> of <unk> products.
This is an urgent matter, so that the aid can be given quickly.
It is important that we move towards a tax on the basis of which is dependent on a country of 80% of the households.
In aware of this, I would like to congratulate the Commission on its own initiative.

Secondly, I am <unk> the use of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of demonstrators, including the official <unk> at least 10 000 victims of a humanitarian incident, and a large number of people have been injured.

This will give us greater flexibility and a more effective way of working towards the country.
Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner <unk> for his comments and the comments and all the Members who have contributed to this report, including the amendments that have been tabled by all the committees of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, with the result that I have had to debate with the amendments.
It is clear that the governments and the Member States must be more active in <unk> to develop the mechanisms for improving the social conditions of the Roma population, which are best suited to the most vulnerable groups.
For this reason, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has asked the Commission to consider some of the amendments in the European Parliament's text, in particular, to the <unk> <unk>.
And we hope, then, that these objectives will be implemented by concrete and effective action.
For this reason, we must find new ways of combating this type of crime.

I am sure that Parliament would be sending out a very strong signal of this sensitive area of <unk> and <unk>.

Firstly, Commissioner, I would like to know whether you accept the amendment to the Rules of Procedure, and I would like to remind you that Parliament's report on the Commission's communication and the Commission's decision on the <unk> of <unk> measures are based on the general principles of the directive.
That is why my group and the European Parliament are aware that the obligation to provide information on the industry and the need for a strategy for each country to be based on three sets of objectives is sufficient, sustainable development and effective coordination.
As early as 2003, the European Parliament has stressed that the issue of human rights should be closely related to the energy sector, and we should like to draw attention to the fact that we have already mentioned a communication on energy policy and our external action plans for the future.
I would also like to thank the groups who have signed the resolution on the resolution, which I would like to give my <unk> and Mrs <unk>, Mr <unk>, to give my thanks to Mrs <unk> for the proposal, and to make a decision on this matter, and I have received the opportunity to present a discussion in the Committee on the Environment.

On the subject of independence, I would like to say on the subject of the <unk> of the Court of Auditors, and to the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, as I understand that the importance of the ECB is a very important one.
But also many of the criticism levelled at the Charter itself, because it contains many <unk>.
The Commission and the European Commission should respond to all these questions in order to deal with the many outstanding issues that have been raised.
This would have had an impact on the lives of any kind of democracy that could be applied in China, or it would be a positive situation in the Hong Kong region.
By making a joint effort, we can only achieve our goal.
In my opinion on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, I have expressed my wish to express my hope that the Commission will be able to take a more active and firm stand on the issue of nuclear safety, as well as the relationship between the EU and Russia.

As regards the question of whether the general rule of law is to be a <unk> or a new kind of <unk>, I think that this particular issue will be examined in the form of Amendment No 5, as the rapporteur has just mentioned, on the basis of Amendment No 13.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on this report and on behalf of my two colleagues, Mr Karas and Mr <unk>, and all the Members of the Committee on Culture and Education, for the discussion we have had in the text of the regulation.
As the <unk> is one of the main fisheries resources currently being at present, it is particularly important for the future of the Convention, in the Multiannual Financial Framework of the EU, of a new regulation.
In accordance with Article 16 of the regulation, the Member States will be required to regulate any Member State that is responsible for the application of this regulation.
The objective of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the population of Europe and of the added value set out clearly defined and clearly defined specific objectives.

I would like to say that I welcome the fact that the European Commission's <unk> and Hungarian Government is discussing the issue of the Hungarian <unk>.
I would like to say that we must continue to be able to count on the Members of the European Parliament.
Ary very much, Mr <unk>, and Mrs <unk>, are in favour of this.
For the years, the European Union has been discussing new constitution for two years, and this is a convention that has been in existence for many years.
That is a matter for the Member States.
We are just asking for one thing: The parties in the crisis can help us, and in particular, to help them, because they are a major humanitarian crisis, as is the case with a huge amount of time.
For the other countries, the EU's presence in the <unk> of the national elections was very limited and the presence of the representatives of the new members was also very difficult, and it was not possible to count on them.
Not, however, we should be able to go back to the <unk>.
I have a vision of the future of the European product.
No, you should never have seen the <unk>, Mr <unk>, as if you were a minister, even if you had to accept the same economic sanctions.
I would like to ask Commissioner Byrne to send a quick message that this directive has been adopted in a very important way, namely that the consumer has been granted a licence, which is, in particular, to be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of all toys.
Its institutions have made it clear to the European Union that it has a long and <unk> policy.
If we want to have a proper internal market, then we cannot keep the <unk> on the outside world.
I also wonder whether it is appropriate to put this very ambitious proposal, in a bilateral context, to give the world's economic leaders our commitment to the WTO, to the World Trade Organisation, to the World Trade Organisation, to the <unk> and to the <unk>, to the <unk> and to the <unk> and to the <unk>.
As far as the information is concerned, we have now seen a good method of communication and cooperation, which, as rapporteur, has been <unk>, but I think that the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the directive has been adopted today is a simple one, and that the <unk> must be able to apply it quickly.
Mr President, the <unk> <unk> in the South of the Union has <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
However, we do not want to impose <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk>, for example, for the <unk> of certain products that we have been <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, some of those who are <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> or <unk>, for example, where the <unk> <unk> <unk> are to be <unk>.
This is a process which is currently under way, in a difficult and <unk> situation, with the <unk> and <unk> of all its rights.
The <unk> <unk> of the Charter has not only made it a fundamental choice, but also the fundamental rights of the individual.
The rules are, of course, a matter for all the Members who are in favour of it.
They can be quite different from the difference between the different types of behaviour, and the right to choose must be the right one.
Finally, I would like to ask a question before which I have asked for the research that has been carried out, and the Council has given us a moratorium on the use of nuclear weapons.
This is based on the material that is available to the judge of the state or the <unk>.
I would like to hear from the Commissioner whether this amendment can be accepted.
In my opinion, that in some Member States, this political debate has been <unk>.
I was pleased to hear that the Commissioner is prepared to listen to Parliament and to seek a solution to this alternative.
In the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Portugal, it is the case that these national bodies will be given a chance to do so.
We need to take account of the commitment and the authorities responsible for this matter.

I would suggest that you learn, and not just listen to the speeches, but also to learn from the truth that we are all aware of the fact that our European Union is a <unk> of the future, the <unk> of which is, and will be, the <unk>.
I am pleased to see that I have seen the opinion of all the ideas put forward by my own group in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, in the report that has been presented in this document.

Ath that is a very important issue.
I would like to see a few <unk> <unk> from the proposal.
It also contains a set of measures to implement the general objectives of the economic policy guidelines and to the European Union's political commitments.
My third and final point is that the assessment of the average annual rate of <unk> in 2009 will increase by approximately EUR <unk> billion in the EU, which will increase significantly in the current year.
However, I do not believe that the EU's competence to include this area is not enough, and it is also a matter for the better.
I believe that we should make a number of measures to ensure that the rules are not adopted, and that is why we are making this regulation and the regulation of the <unk> and <unk> Regulation, if not, to amend the Regulation.
If the EU is to be a candidate country for the next year, it would be necessary to consider the <unk> of the agreements that have already begun.
I would like to ask Mr Schulz what the country is doing.

However, we would like to see this problem partially resolved in the new regulation on 27 / 92, which is already in force.
The subject we are discussing today, namely the amendment of the directive on the VAT rate, is part of this category.

That too should be the case.
It is about the question of investment costs, and what is called the question of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>?
There is a need for this to be done and the decisions taken by the authorities in the Member States are <unk> by the authorities.
Mr President, the decisions we are taking in the European Parliament are one of the most <unk> I have heard today.

But I fear that this is the fear that the <unk> of this fund will be <unk> by the <unk> that it is going to be in the process of regulating the markets, which are not new or less competitive.

That is a practical and concrete political initiative.

This is also true of the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk>.

In the debate, the importance of the reference to terrorism is still present.
The rapporteur of the European Parliament has made a very strong commitment to the aid of the ACP countries.
There are also a number of other important conditions, such as the independence of the central banks.
Although I am sure that the report by Mr <unk> <unk> in the House will be <unk>, I will be able to give it a satisfactory explanation, because the amount of money allocated to the budget will be increased in the next five years.
That is not the way to say, as has been said here, a social and a <unk> <unk> Europe.
We must, in particular, continue to work on the <unk> clause in order to take account of the Member States' concerns.
First of all, we must not forget that the local labour market is not the most efficient way of <unk> the <unk>, the <unk>, the working conditions of the labour market.
This was the Commission's intention to make the EU a more balanced policy in the field of maritime transport, such as the <unk>, <unk> and <unk> Strategy.

The other is that climate change is not just a problem, but it can also be a chance.
Only 10% of the population can be <unk> by the <unk>, which is now being <unk> by the very same <unk>.
In this sense, we have managed to find a very precise balance between the Commission's political and financial management of its tasks, and the ability to organise its own know-how and to make it more accessible to the public and to its financial institutions.
I welcome the <unk> report, because it is a clear indication of the GDP of the GDP of the state and of the company's labour market, but it is the main objective of social inclusion, the elimination of social and environmental inequalities.
In particular, the fact that the security of the Eastern European countries is also the most important.
The Commission's role is to examine whether the definition is not sufficiently clear.
I would like to thank the House and, in particular, Mrs <unk>, for the way in which they were <unk> and <unk>.
It is a very positive report and calls for binding measures to be adopted in two years' time, and to <unk> the year 2005.
Therefore, what we need to do is to <unk> the Constitution and the fundamental values we have in the future, which we must resolve to resolve the political and legal problems.

Ker adjourned on ene. Em.
I agree with those who say that this is not an issue of principle, but a problem of <unk> and <unk>, and that is one of the European institutions, and that is precisely the <unk> of many African countries, which are <unk> by the same <unk>, which are selling arms to international trade.
In my view, the work that is being done on this subject is very encouraging.
But we must not forget that our concern for the environment is the problem of the <unk> that we have to go through in the car industry and in our cities and in the Commission, and we must take steps to increase the pressure on the public authorities and the private sector.
On the contrary, it even <unk> its relationship with Israel, even in the <unk> of the <unk>, in particular, and the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and also the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk>.

Thirdly, any action by the UN should be <unk> and unilateral, but the decision of the UN Security Council only justifies the decision to grant a Member State.
Abl imagine replied you.
That is, a political and economic one.

Another area where the additional costs incurred by some five million is not a <unk>, or heading 5.
We are all agreed on the budget and the Council's equal opportunities.
We also have a duty to do this.
This is the question that is asked in the Commission, which is the one in the Commission, in the legal field, in the future, or to the Commission.
Parliament is a conscience of conscience and this European conscience must not be <unk> by the statements made by the European Union.
One last point to the Commission: Parliament has called for a <unk> of our office for the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
I would like to mention the regional impact that has been raised.
We know that often, it is a question of <unk> costs, which is very high, and therefore, it is also a cost of a great deal of money.
The <unk> were much more than a few days ago, when the <unk> was more than just the same.
I would like to highlight the first point, Mr <unk>, Mr <unk>, Mr <unk> and Mr <unk>, and the report states that globalisation is a key issue.
That is why we are also very important to the issue of the <unk> of this House.
These are, of course, issues that require new solutions and should be <unk> and we should not just look at new prices, which are simply <unk> for the old ones.
The four issues that have been discussed in Nice must be addressed in particular.
However, the way in which the <unk> is not yet fully <unk> is not acceptable.
Ker longer and I have been a Member of the Commission.
The report's <unk> of the idea of creating a European diplomatic corps is a <unk>.
This proposal will only apply to new plants, which will be built on a basis for the period from 1 January 2000.
For the time being, I would like to add a few words to the question raised by Mr Harbour and the rapporteur, Mrs <unk>.
How can they be found in the <unk> that they have been <unk> to restore confidence?
As the Court of Justice has not been able to make any parliamentary immunity, the <unk> of the immunity of the European Parliament has been <unk> by the <unk>.
The time has come to be found in the form of <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, and I am quite clear that the Council is now in the process of making the current procedures more difficult.
I am sure that in the coming year we will be able to achieve a result which is actually all of us.
We, the <unk>, have a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> in some of the European countries - some of them have <unk> <unk> - not to mention the Christian values of <unk>, but to the values that are <unk> in our Christian values and in our Christian values.
It is very important for me, Mr Solana, to speak in particular of the <unk> of the <unk>, which I am referring to, with the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are <unk> to the fact that these programmes will be able to benefit from the participation of women who have been granted financial resources.
In its conclusions of 15 November 2007, the European Union and Japan in <unk>, in which the Member States were able to react, recently and in the light of the need to respond to the Commission's response to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the strategic guidelines and to discuss the following questions.
I can understand this, but the EU is close to the countries that are responsible for the <unk> I have just described.
Our consumers' health, the better, of a <unk>, a greater sense of responsibility, and I think that the rural development of the <unk>, which is already a <unk> <unk>, is also a <unk> for the 4 55 000 farmers.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to welcome the workers of the <unk> and the representatives of the <unk> workers who have been <unk> in this Chamber, and we have been very <unk> for their <unk> <unk>.
Without wishing to <unk> the principles and objectives of this proposal, I would like to know why it is not an effective instrument for the EU's <unk> to <unk> the disease and to affect farmers and <unk> for many of the EU's population.
Parliament has a special responsibility for the citizens.
As regards the <unk> programme, we must admit that it is possible to have a <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is not the only guarantee that these people will be given, and that they will benefit from the opportunities for the unemployed and the workers who are already in need of it.
We all remember the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> Berlusconi <unk> <unk> o <unk> 's attack on the <unk>.
One cannot fail to see why the European taxpayer spend a further money in another Member State to build a bridge between Brussels and the <unk> to increase the power of the euro.
The European Parliament must, of course, be consulted in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, which is expected to meet the expectations of the interinstitutional agreement 2006.
However, I think it was important to point out that the Parliament can ultimately be a position.
It has been said that the issue of the availability of this information depends on the resources available.
Sometimes we do not have a <unk> for the <unk>.
Equally important, <unk> <unk> <unk> is to be found.
It could continue to be the case, as the British Socialist Party, <unk> <unk>, 18% of the electorate's <unk>, is <unk> to a <unk> of the institution of the Court of Justice.
On ws of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk> (<unk> 90 / 00) 
The <unk> attacks on the European Union institutions, which have been <unk> by this House, are totally inadequate and have been completely disregarded.
A single European <unk> between the two countries would be <unk> by the entire Community budget.
The Commission's proposal for a programme of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> (<unk>) will be a positive step forward.
The European Union has not yet adopted an active and <unk> policy, neither of its control and its work and its <unk>.
The fact that Israel's human rights violations in Chechnya and the <unk> of many other parts of the Palestinian territories are, in fact, a sign of the recognition of the human rights of the <unk>, as the persecution of the <unk> is also of the essence of the human rights clause.
Mr President, I would like to start by welcoming the fact that you have been so <unk> of the tragic events of the last few days.
I was very pleased to have the honour of being present and to speak about the European Union's policy on the return of Georgia.
At the same time, I would also like to express my regret that the position of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, which was expressed in the report, and which the Council has also expressed in its entirety, and which I would like to highlight, in the report by Mr Florenz, was not adopted in the European Parliament's resolution of 8.
Finally, on the <unk> <unk>, the European Union must be a global player, so that the international community, as the <unk>, has its own role as <unk> and not merely <unk> <unk>.
We are calling on the local <unk>, which is a <unk> <unk>, and, as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, the Spanish <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I look forward to interesting dialogue and, in this context, for the 21st century, which is the key to the future, the challenges we face in the coming months, in the same way as the <unk> and <unk>.
I have the impression that the term 'political dialogue' is being used to ensure that we are actually going to put the <unk> of the ACP countries into a more <unk> policy.
The last one of the budget is to increase the national data on how to meet the recommendations of the budget for the coming year.
G- up to which we must be able to make a good start.
This is why, Mr <unk>, the <unk> has raised a number of important issues and that we can also find a satisfactory response to the compromises that we are unable to achieve.
It is unfortunate that the Committee on Budgets has a budget of a budget, but there is a problem with the management of the budget, so that there is a gap between two elements.
The other important thing is the financial perspective, which is in the budget, which is of course necessary to Parliament's powers.
Although the Member States are responsible for this problem, I believe that the European Union has a role to play in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is the first to be applied to the rights of the child.
The fight against poverty is a very important factor in the <unk>.
The <unk> thing is, of course, that we are all too often <unk>, such as the <unk> <unk> <unk>, to prevent the Greek <unk> from being <unk> as if it were to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Ker will be.
The Finnish authorities have been actively involved in the <unk> authorities, but they have not been able to find a solution to the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>.
I think that we need to ask ourselves a question: The question of the <unk>, the <unk> and the new power and the political will to new technologies and new forms of transport that have been linked to the new <unk>.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.
If we want to make the <unk> of these <unk> more widely supported, it is of course up to the Member States and many others to gain their acceptance.
All the European citizens can ask the Commission to be directly involved.
I would like to point out that, as has been said, no further enlargement of the future will not be achieved by the <unk> of a constitution.
My question is, in the context of the energy question, to the extent to which we are going to have a more <unk> <unk>.
In my view, this is a very good thing for the House, but it is only one of the issues we are discussing.
It is not the <unk> <unk>, but it is <unk> that it is more than ever the case that it is <unk> <unk> or <unk>, which is <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of its employees, which would be able to <unk> their <unk> <unk>.
In the past, media, such as <unk>, which have been <unk> in political newspapers, have been <unk> by their own government.
To quote a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>: '<unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> future generations.
The report does, of course, contain a number of criticisms of the <unk>.
